## Introduction

This report provides an overview and low-level design specification for an ADC LCD Interface, displaying analog sensor data (e.g., from a potentiometer or LDR) on an LCD. It includes configuration settings for upper (HHM) and lower (LLM) threshold limits, which can be adjusted through keypad input, with alerts triggered when readings exceed these limits. This design uses native C programming, without Arduino-based code or pre-developed libraries.

### Purpose
The purpose of this specification is to outline the internal structure, functional components, and embedded constraints for implementing the ADC LCD Interface module, forming the basis for coding and module testing.

### Scope
The scope of this document includes:

- Design and implementation of the ADC LCD Interface system.
- Integration of analog sensors (e.g., potentiometer or LDR) and display of their values on an LCD screen.
- User-configurable threshold limits via keypad input.
- Alert mechanism to notify the user when sensor readings exceed the defined limits.

This document serves as the reference for both coding and module testing, ensuring that the system works within the defined constraints and meets the project requirements.

The module priority is classified as P2, indicating that it is a necessary part of the system but not critical for initial deployment.

### Assumptions & Constraints

1. This system assumes stable input from sensors, using averaging to reduce noise.
2. The LCD display has limited character space, requiring concise data representation.
3. The module operates within the 8-bit MCU memory constraints and processing capacity.

```plantuml
@startuml
(*) --> Init
Init --> ConfigureADC_UART_LCD
ConfigureADC_UART_LCD --> AwaitKeyInput
AwaitKeyInput --> SetChannel
SetChannel --> If "Key = 1" then
    If --> DisplayPotValue

else if "Key = 2" then
    If --> DisplayLDRValue

else
    If --> AwaitKeyInput
endif
@enduml
```

## Functional Description
The ADC LCD Interface reads analog values from sensors connected to specified ADC channels. Data is sampled (for noise reduction) and displayed on an LCD. Threshold limits for sensor readings can be adjusted using a keypad, and UART communication sends real-time data to an external monitor.

## Implementation of the Module
This chapter discusses the detailed design of the module.

- LCD:
Initialize the LCD with the appropriate commands.
Set up the data and control pins for communication.
Clear the display and set the cursor position.
- Keypad:
Configure the keypad's rows and columns as input pins.
Use a scanning technique to detect keypresses.
- ADC:
Configure the ADC module with the desired resolution and sampling rate.
Select the analog input channel to be read.
- UART:
Configure the UART module with the baud rate, parity, stop bits, and data bits.
- DIO:
Configure the desired pins as input or output.
Set the direction and initial state of each pin.
- Main Loop:
Read Input:
Read keypresses from the keypad.
Read analog values from the ADC.
Process Data:
Process the input data as required (e.g., calculate values, make decisions).
Update Output:
Display information on the LCD.
Control devices connected to the DIO pins.
Transmit data over the UART.
